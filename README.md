Hello! Im Juan Bianchi, im working on becoming a full stack Python developer, i know this isn't gonna be easy but im gonna try my best.

Im currently working on 2 courses, 1 Python related and another Java related.

Although i barely just started i still want to find my way through programming, i really enjoy doing it so at least im having fun.
I hope whatever i end up creating and uploading to github can be of interest to whomever looks at it.

Although im just starting i have knowledge on Python 2.8, C/C++ and Java. I also have a CodeWars account where i do daily practice.

My plan is to use the courses along with daily practice and focus in order to start my carrer.

I dont really have much more to add here, so i hope you can find something to look at :).

I am testing how github works for now :D
